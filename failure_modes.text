FAILURE MODES-

in this following guide we explain the expected failures and how we would handle
them if this was a real-world project.


1. Machine Failure:
Failure Mode:
One or more machines in the system go offline or become non-responsive.
Handling: 
Implement redundancy by using multiple machines and load balancing techniques
to distribute the workload. Set up monitoring systems to detect machine failures quickly 
and automatically redirect traffic to healthy machines. Maintain a backup of critical data
and regularly test the restoration process.

2. Network Split:
Failure Mode: 
Network connectivity is lost between different components or locations of the system.
Handling: 
Design the system to be resilient to network splits by utilizing distributed 
systems and replication techniques. Implement mechanisms like heartbeats and timeouts 
to detect network failures and initiate failover or fallback procedures. Use techniques 
such as sharding or partitioning to ensure that network splits do not affect the entire 
system.

3.Data Corruption:
Failure Mode: 
Data stored in the system becomes corrupted or unreadable.
Handling: 
Implement data integrity checks, such as checksums or hash functions, to verify data 
integrity during storage and retrieval. Regularly perform backups and implement versioning 
or snapshot mechanisms to restore data to a previous known-good state. 
Use error-detection and error-correction codes where appropriate.

4.Security Breach:
Failure Mode: 
Unauthorized access, data breaches, or compromised system security.
Handling: 
Employ strong security measures, such as authentication, encryption, and access controls,
to protect the system. Regularly update and patch software and infrastructure components 
to address vulnerabilities. Monitor system logs and implement intrusion detection systems 
to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Have incident response plans in 
place to minimize damage and recover from security breaches.
